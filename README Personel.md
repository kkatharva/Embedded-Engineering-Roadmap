## 🛠️ My Embedded Systems Engineer Roadmap

Forked from [m3y54m]([https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap])

I'm currently following this roadmap to strengthen my Embedded Systems skills.

### 🧠 My Goals:
- To Understand microcontrollers
- Master the communication protocols (SPI, I2C, UART)
- Make real-world projects using ESP8266, Arduino, etc.
- Become a Embedded System Engineer
